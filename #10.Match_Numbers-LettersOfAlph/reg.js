/*
Match Numbers and Letters of the Alphabet

Using the hyphen (-) to match a range of characters is not limited to letters. 
It also works to match a range of numbers.

For example, /[0-5]/ matches any number between 0 and 5, including the 0 and 5.

Also, it is possible to combine a range of letters and numbers in a single character set
